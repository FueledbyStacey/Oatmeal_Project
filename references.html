<h1>Eating Rules</h1>
<p><a href="https://eatingrules.com/" title="Eating Rules" target="_blank">Eating Rules</a>, created by Andrew Wilder, was used to help aid in describing the appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times for the different types of oats. 
The guest post, <a href="https://eatingrules.com/types-of-oatmeal/" title="The Types of Oatmeal" target="_blank">The Types of Oatmeal</a> by vegetarian dietitian Kristine Duncan, highlighted the differences between the different types of oats regarding their appearances, textures, sizes, and cooking times.

how many of the oats available on the U.S. market are prepared/processed before being bought by consumers, fun facts about oats, and so much more.

<p><a href=https://www.thekitchn.com/about" title="The Kitchn">The Kitchn</a>, a web magazine that focuses on every possible aspect of home cooking (i.e. kitchen designs, product reviews, recipes, etc.),

What's the Difference Between Steel-Cut, Rolled, and Instant Oats?</a>, by Kelli Foster, the differences

that the Oat Groat (the original form that oats come in after being harvested) undergoes. These differences Steel Cut, Old Fashioned Oats/Rolled Oats,
 and Instant Oats have due to levels of processing, were used to help in describing the different cooking times, the texture and taste differences,
and uses for each of the oats in The Oatmeal Project.</p>
